## Description

This model was created to explain how to recognice the gender of a person based in the face using CNN(Convolutional Neural network) with Keras.

## Virtual enviroment

You can create a virtual environment using following commands.

In linux maybe you need the following package `sudo apt-get install python3-venv`

| Description|Linux| Win|
| ------ | ------ |------|
| Install virtenv| `python3 -m pip install --user virtualenv` |`py -m pip install --user virtualenv`|
| Create enviroment | `python3 -m venv modelTrainerEnv` |`py -m venv modelTrainerEnv`|
| Activate enviroment | `source modelTrainerEnv/bin/activate` |`.\modelTrainerEnv\Scripts\activate`|
| Install packages | `pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt`  |`pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt` |
| Inactivate  | `deactivate`  | `deactivate`  |

## USE

This project is a CNN based in a large-scale image recognition training model, as called VGG, this model is based in layers and a compression of an image, the schema is explained in the following graph:

### Training

To train the model just run with python 3.6 and the environment created the file __training.py__, ensure the route of the 'datadir' variable is set as your dataset photos is.
To download the dataset you can see follow URL.

### Recognition

To run the recognition ensure the model is in the folder 'model' and run __detection.py__ and comment the variable 'model_path', if you haven't the model the app download a model automatically.
